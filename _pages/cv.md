Education
======
* Imperial College London, 10.2017-present
  * MRes Medical Robotics and Image Guided Intervention
* The University of Edinburgh,  09.2013-06.2016
  * M. Eng (Hons) Mechanical Engineering (2:1)
* South China University of Technology, 09.2011-07.2013
  * B. Eng. Mechanical Engineering and Automation (3.14/4.00)


Research Experience (Individual)
======
* Summer 2017: Academic research internship in legged robot
  * Zhejiang Univeristy 
  * Duties included: Research in robust control of bipedal walking for leg robot and carried out physical experiment in Intelligence Robot Lab in Zhejiang University, China.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Yucai Zhu

* 09.2016-06.2017: Academic research internship in humanoid robot
  * The University of Edinburgh
  * Duties included: I was doing research in bipedal walking of humanoid robotics using online parameter estimation in SLMC group and NASA Valkyrie group in School of Informatics, The University of Edinburgh.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Zhibin Li

* 03-08.2015: Industrial Robotics Researcher Assistant (Funded by Erasmus+)
  * The Institute of Production Engineering and Machine Tools (IFW), Leibniz University of Hanover
  * Duties included: A two degree of freedom (DOF) robot prototype in the laboratory is developed to 3 DOF by adding an additional axis at Axis 3 to achieve enough flexibility for an industrial-level milling process. Thus, the model was first built up in Creo for analysis. Therefore, several concepts for the transmission device for the additional axis was developed in Creo and analysed with the help of MATLAB Simulink. And multi body static simulation on 6 DOF KUKA robot is also built.
  * Supervisor: Dipl.-Ing.Thomas Lepper 


Research Experience (Group)
======
* 10.2017-present: Vision-based Navigation in Flexible Endoscopy (Group Project)
  * Imperial College London
  * Duties included: This project is to develop a method of simultaneously mapping the human colon and tracking the endoscope pose in real time during flexible endoscopy based on visual-inertial SLAM.

* 09-11.2014: CCS design project
  * The University of Edinburgh
  * Duties included: The new natural gas combined cycle plant is design to provide net power output of around 1000Mwe near Cockenzie. Amine capture plant with absorber intercooling is finally developed to reach 90.2% CO2 capture and 50.91% net plant efficiency as modelling in UniSim®.

* 01-04.2014: Design of a Floating Production System for a Marginal North Sea Oil Field
  * The University of Edinburgh
  * Duties included: The design is a floating production buoy for a marginal oil field, which is located in the northern North Sea at 200m depth. The structure must be able to sustain an additional payload of 2000 tonnes. In charge of mooring system, I compared different concepts of mooring system including products from company and patents and selected tension leg for our final design. The SeaStar TLP is developed in Solid Edge for its combination of excellent wave response, and low costs based on simulation in MATLAB in group report.

* 09-11.2013: Design of New Style Solar Oven   
  * The University of Edinburgh
  * Duties included: A thermal storage solar cooker is developed to reach theoretical steady-state temperature range of 105-170°C for the 2013 Engineers Without Borders challenge, as a solution to the problem of renewable clean cooking technologies for the town of Codo in the Lautém district of Timor-Leste.

Competition and Awards
======
* 10.2015 - 01.2016: Hyperloop Team Member, Levitation Group
 * Awarded by Space Exploration Technologies Corporation for Subsystem Excellence Award
 * It is a conceptual high-speed transportation system competition organized by SpaceX. Hyperloop is incorporating reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors. I am in the levitation group to design the suspension by Solid Edge and air bearing system simulated by MATLAB and Star-CCM+ for our Hyperloop design.
