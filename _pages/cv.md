Education
======
* Imperial College London, 10.2017-present
  * MRes Medical Robotics and Image Guided Intervention
* The University of Edinburgh,  09.2013-06.2016
  * M. Eng (Hons) Mechanical Engineering (2:1)
* South China University of Technology, 09.2011-07.2013
  * B. Eng. Mechanical Engineering and Automation (3.14/4.00)


Research Experience (Individual)
======
* Summer 2017: Academic research internship in legged robot
  * Zhejiang Univeristy 
  * Duties included: Research in robust control of bipedal walking for leg robot and carried out physical experiment in Intelligence Robot Lab in Zhejiang University, China.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Yucai Zhu

* 09.2016-06.2017: Academic research internship in humanoid robot
  * The University of Edinburgh
  * Duties included: I was doing research in bipedal walking of humanoid robotics using online parameter estimation in SLMC group and NASA Valkyrie group in School of Informatics, the University of Edinburgh.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Zhibin Li

* 03-08.2015: Industrial Robotics Researcher Assistant (Funded by Erasmus+)
  * The Institute of Production Engineering and Machine Tools (IFW), Leibniz University of Hanover
  * Duties included: A two degree of freedom (DOF) robot prototype in the laboratory is developed to 3 DOF by adding an additional axis at Axis 3 to achieve enough flexibility for an industrial-level milling process. Thus, the model was first built up in Creo for analysis. Therefore, several concepts for the transmission device for the additional axis was developed in Creo and analysed with the help of MATLAB Simulink. And multi body static simulation on 6 DOF KUKA robot is also built.
  * Supervisor: Dipl.-Ing.Thomas Lepper 


Research Experience (Grooup)
======
* 10.2017-present: Vision-based Navigation in Flexible Endoscopy (Group Project)
  * Imperial College London
  * Duties included: This project is to develop a method of simultaneously mapping the human colon and tracking the endoscope pose in real time during flexible endoscopy based on visual-inertial SLAM.
