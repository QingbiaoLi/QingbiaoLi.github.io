Biography
======

<!-- --------------------------------Third Person --------------------------- -->
<!-- Qingbiao Li is a PhD student at ProrokLab, the Digital Technology Group (DTG) at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of [Dr Amanda Prorok](https://www.proroklab.org/). 
His research interests include:
* Robot Learning, Multi-robot Path Planning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Imitation Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

During his PhD, he focus on **communication-aware motion planning** for multi-robot coordination. 
He is effectively investigating **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)** to build communication channels for multi-agent and multi-robot systems so that agents/robots can learn how to communicate between each other explicitly. 
His research can be applied in mobility-on-demand, automated warehouse and smart cities. 

Prior to joining Cambridge,  he joined [Hamlyn Centre](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/hamlyn-centre/) at Imperial College London, found by [Prof Guang-Zhong Yang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276270800) and [Prof the Lord Ara Darzi](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.darzi) in the field of medical robots and healthcare for  the MRes in Medical Robotics and Image-Guided Intervention. He was supervised by [Prof Daniel Elson](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/daniel.elson) for eight-month research project about oxygen saturation (StO2) estimation, and graduated with Distinction for MRes degree. He also held a MEng degree in Mechanical Engineeringat  University of Edinburgh. 

He has published papers in medical imaging area (IJCARS) and robotics field (IEEE IROS, IEEE Humanoids and AAMAS). He has served as a reviewer for IEEE IROS, IEEE ICRA, IEEE RA-L, IEEE T-RO and AAMAS.

Details of his CV can be found at [PDF](./files/CV_QingbiaoLi.pdf). -->
