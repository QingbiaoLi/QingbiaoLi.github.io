<p>Despite knowing the journey and where it leads, I embrace it, and I welcome every moment of it.</p>

Vision
======
<div style="text-align: justify"> 

<p> I believe that technology should contribute to humanity toward a healthier, safer, and higher quality of life.  </p> 

<p> I am an enthusiast and believer in the new revolution for robotics (Artificial General Intelligence for Robotics). I believe that the 'real2sim (meta-verse) and sim2real' can bring the community (machine learning, computer vision and graphics, and robotics) towards the era of technology beyond first-principle-based methods and control theory. Yet, there is a huge research gap towards this revolution. I believe robotics can be one of the solutions for population aging via the autonomous system and human-robot collaboration. </p> 

<p> I am a part-time researcher in AI for Health and Science (medical imaging and intro-operative imaging for surgical robotics).  </p> 

<!-- <p> Thoughout my research jounery towards this revolution so far, I have been inspired by my superivisor (<a href="https://www.proroklab.org/" style="color:#5dbcd2;">Prof Amanda Prorok</a>),  (<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.aam8638" style="color:#5dbcd2;"> Prof Guang-zhong Yang</a>-->

Biography
======

<p>I am currently a PhD student at ProrokLab in the Digital Technology Group (DTG) at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of <a href="https://www.proroklab.org/" style="color:#5dbcd2;">Prof Amanda Prorok</a>. During my PhD, I focus on <b>communication-aware motion planning</b> for multi-robot coordination. I am investigating <b>Graph Neural Networks (GNN)</b> to build communication channels for multi-agent and multi-robot systems so that they can learn how to communicate between each other explicitly. 
 My research can be applied to mobility-on-demand systems, automated warehouses, and smart cities.</p> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

<p>Prior to joining Cambridge, I was working in <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/hamlyn-centre/" style="color:#5dbcd2;">the Hamlyn Centre</a> at Imperial College London, founded by <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276270800" style="color:#5dbcd2;">Prof Guang-Zhong Yang</a> and <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.darzi" style="color:#5dbcd2;">the Lord Ara Darzi</a>,  in the field of medical robotics and healthcare to earn my MRes in Medical Robotics and Image-Guided Intervention. I was supervised by <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/daniel.elson" style="color:#5dbcd2;">Prof Daniel Elson</a> for an eight-month research project about oxygen saturation (StO2) estimation, and graduated with a distinction. I also hold an MEng degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Edinburgh.</p> 

<p>I have published papers in the medical imaging area (IJCARS) and the robotics field (IEEE Humanoids, IEEE IROS, IEEE ICRA, IEEE RA-L and AAMAS). I have served as a reviewer for IEEE IROS, IEEE ICRA, IEEE RA-L, IEEE T-RO, Autonomous Robots (AURO) and AAMAS.</p>
