I am a student in Imperial College London. My previous study gave me strong CAD model designing skill as shown in portfolio. The half year exchange experience in IFW, Hannover, built my individual research ability especially the design of industrial robot as well as basic control. My current MRes programme will enhance my understand of imaging process and mechanism of medical robot by core courses and build me into an individual research via 8 months research.
