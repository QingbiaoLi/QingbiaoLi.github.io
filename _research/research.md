* 02.2018 - 09.2018,  Estimation of Tissue Oxygen Saturation based on Image to Image Translation (Invidiual project)
  * Biophotonics Lab, Imperial College London 
  * Duties included:
    * The conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) was used to develop pixel-level image-to-image translation approach, called RGB2StO2, to estimate tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) from RGB images directly
    * Dual-input network, called Dual2StO2, was developed to investigate the optimal setting of the fibre bundle to capture meaningful and informative images from HSI camera. 
  * Supervisor: Prof.Daniel S Elson
