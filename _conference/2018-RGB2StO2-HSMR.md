Abstract: In this paper, we first applied a pixel-level image-to-image translation approach based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) to estimate tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) from RGB images directly. The real-time performance and non-reliance on additional hardware, enable a seamless integration of the proposed method into surgical and diagnostic workflows with standard endoscope systems.
